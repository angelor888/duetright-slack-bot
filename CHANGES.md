# Changes Made to DuetRight Slack Bot

## Version 2.0 - Multi-User Support

### 🎯 Problem Fixed
**Before**: Only messages from user "Sky" would trigger auto-pinning
**After**: ALL users can now trigger auto-pinning

### 📝 Changes Made

1. **Removed User Restriction** (index.js lines 36-45)
   - Deleted the `isFromSky` check that limited functionality to one user
   - Replaced with logging that tracks which user triggered the bot

2. **Updated Logging**
   - Now logs the username of whoever triggers the bot
   - Helps track usage across all team members

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README.md
   - Added .env.example for easy setup
   - Updated package.json with proper dependencies

### ✅ What Still Works
- Channel restrictions remain (only project channels)
- Pattern matching still requires `*message*` format
- Pushpin reaction still added to pinned messages

### 🧪 Testing
Run `node test-bot.js` to verify the bot behavior with different users.

### 🚀 How to Deploy
1. Pull the latest changes
2. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies
3. Restart the bot
4. Test with different users posting `*messages*` in project channels

All team members can now use the auto-pinning feature! 🎉
